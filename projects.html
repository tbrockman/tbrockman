        <h2> - under construction</h2>
        <p>A software instrument controlled primarily by eye-movement. Proof-of-concept created for an arts course project at the University of Sydney using <a href='https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu'>WebGazer.js</a> and <a href='https://tonejs.github.io/'>Tone.js</a>, future work to be done using the <a href='https://tobiigaming.com/'>Tobii Eye Tracker.</a></p>

        <h2 data-repo='schizophoner' data-owner='tbrockman'></h2>
        <p>A simple Android application created for an arts course project exploring "the split of sounds and their events." Once room level is calibrated, can be used to record and play audio simulatenously. Sound events above a certain threshold can be buffered in a queue/random order and then played back later replacing current events.</p>
