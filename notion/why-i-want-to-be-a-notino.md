I'm excited about knowledge organization, I think there's a lot to be done to improve productivity through how we search and store information and the things we care about.

Humans, like computers, can only retain a limited amount of information in cache. Inevitably, we have to commit things to "long term" storage, which can get slower and slower to query the more we have on disk. *Not to mention* that the accuracy of the information that's returned can even *degrade* over time.

Naturally, it seems pretty obvious to supplement this process with something a bit more robust and less prone to failure. 

## *enter technology!*

Technology offers us quite a few distinct improvements over our fleshy biology in this regard. Notably, we can store a lot of bits pretty reliably, and we can even recover from storage failures if necessary. Devising increasingly efficient processes for both serializing and retrieving this information (in an intuitive and user-friendly way) can have a massive impact on humanity as a whole by facilitating seamless data-driven lifestyles. I would be incredibly interested and fortunate to work in this area.

I think technology has done a fantastic job with helping people discover the internet, but I think it's currently lacking when it comes to helping people discover themselves. It seems like most applications fumble at some point facilitating a users data journey from creation to discovery,
and after using the product and looking through some of the team videos, [Notion](https://notion.so) seems like a great place to start capitalizing on that.

I have ideas for the platform and would love to join the team.
