I'm excited about knowledge organization, I think there's a lot to be done to improve productivity through how we search and store information and the things we care about.

Humans, like computers, can only retain a limited amount of information in cache. Inevitably, we have to commit things to "long term" storage, which can get slower and slower to query the more we have on disk. *Not to mention* that the accuracy of the information that's returned can even *degrade* over time.

Naturally, it seems pretty obvious to supplement this process with something a bit more robust and less prone to failure. 

## *enter technology!*

Technology offers us quite a few distinct benefits over our fleshy biology in this regard. We can store a lot of bits pretty reliably, and we can even recover from storage failures if necessary.

I think technology has done a fantastic job with helping people discover the internet, but I think it's currently lacking when it comes to helping people discover themselves. It seems like most applications fumble at some point facilitating a users data journey from creation to discovery 
and [Notion](https://notion.so) seems like a great place to start capitalizing on that.

I have ideas for the platform and would love to join the team.
