			<h1>So what is phishing?</h1>
			<p>Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit
			card details (and money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in
			an electronic communication. (1, 2)
			Phishing attacks are more rampant than ever before, rising by more than 162 percent from 2010 to
			2014. They cost organizations around the globe $4.5 billion every year and over half of internet users
			get at least one phishing email per day.
			You can see how if sensitive information got into the wrong hands it could not only compromise you
			but the company you work for or any affiliates you have.
			So before you know how to protect yourself you need to be familiar with the different types of
			fishing.</p>

			<h1>Different types of fishing</h1>

			<h2>Spear phishing</h2>
			<p>Tailored to a specific victim or group of victims</p>
			Spear phishing is phishing attempts directed at a specific company or individuals. For Spear phasing
			attacks most attackers gather personal data about their targets which increases the likelihood of
			their success. Spear phishing counts for 91% of all successful attacks

			<h2>Clone Phishing</h2>
			<p>When a legitimate email is cloned, and the attachments or links are replaced with malicious versions
			of them</p>
			<p>Clone phishing attacks occur when a legitimate, and previously delivered email with an attachment
			or link is ‘cloned’. This cloned emails attachment or link is the sent with the attachment or link
			replaced and sent from an address similar to the original sender. They could justify this resending by
			claiming it is an updated version or a resend of the original</p>

			<h2>Whaling</h2>
			<p>Whaling are phishing attempts that are aimed at people in top positions in an organisation.</p>
			<p>Whaling attacks are targeted at more higher level positions in a business. Due to the targets the
			emails will take be of a more serious level. The contact of a whaling attach is usually legal subpoena,
			customer complaint, or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to masquerade as a
			critical business email, sent from a legitimate business authority. The content is meant to be tailored
			for upper management, and usually involves some kind of falsified company-wide concern. Whaling
			phishers have also forged official-looking FBI subpoena emails, and claimed that the manager needs
			to click a link and install special software to view the subpoena. [
			Link Manipulation</p>

			<p>The most common type of phishing will use some form of link manipulation. This design is intended
			to make a link in an email, and the website the link directs to, look as legitimate as possible to
			courses</p>

			<h1>How to protect yourself from being phished</h1>
			<h2>Tip 1: Don’t trust the display name</h2>
			<p>A favorited phishing tactic among cybercriminals is to spoof the display name of an email. This
			fraudulent email, once delivered, appears legitimate because most user inboxes only present the
			display name. Don’t trust the display name. Check the email address in the header from—if looks
			suspicious, don’t open the email.</p>

			<h2>Tip 2: Look but don’t click</h2>
			<p>Hover your mouse over any links embedded in the body of the email. If the link address looks weird,
			don’t click on it. If you want to test the link, open a new window and type in website address directly
			rather than clicking on the link from unsolicited emails.</p>

			<h2>Tip 3: Check for spelling mistakes</h2>
			<p>Brands are pretty serious about email. Legitimate messages usually do not have major spelling
			mistakes or poor grammar. Read your emails carefully and report anything that seems suspicious.</p>

			<h2>Tip 4: Analyse the salutation</h2>
			<p>Is the email addressed to a vague “Valued Customer?” If so, watch out—legitimate businesses will
			often use a personal salutation with your first and last name.</p>

			<h2>Tip 5: Don’t give up personal information</h2>
			<p>Legitimate banks and most other companies will never ask for personal credentials via email. Don’t
			give them up.</p>

			<h2>Tip 6: Beware of urgent or threatening language in the subject line</h2>
			<p>Invoking a sense of urgency or fear is a common phishing tactic. Beware of subject lines that claim
			your “account has been suspended” or your account had an “unauthorized login attempt.”</p>

			<h2>Tip 7: Review the signature</h2>
			<p>Lack of details about the signer or how you can contact a company strongly suggests a phish.
			Legitimate businesses always provide contact details.</p>

			<h2>Tip 8: Don’t click on attachments</h2>
			<p>Including malicious attachments that contain viruses and malware is a common phishing tactic.
			Malware can damage files on your computer, steal your passwords or spy on you without your
			knowledge. Don’t open any email attachments you weren’t expecting.</p>

			<h2>Tip 9: Don’t trust the header from email address</h2>
			<p>Fraudsters not only spoof brands in the display name, but also spoof brands in the header from
			email address. Return Path found that nearly 30% of more than 760,000 email threats spoofed
			brands somewhere in the header from email address with more than two thirds spoofing the brand
			in the email domain alone.</p>

			<h2>Tip 10: Don’t believe everything you see</h2>
			<p>Phishers are extremely good at what they do. Just because an email has convincing brand logos,
			language, and a seemingly valid email address, does not mean that it’s legitimate. Be sceptical when
			it comes to your email messages—if it looks even remotely suspicious, don’t open it.
			Most successful phishing attacks were disguised as something an employee was expecting, like an
			HR document, a shipping confirmation or a request to change a password that looked like it came
			from the IT department.
			Make sure to scrutinize any such emails before you download attachments or click on any included
			links, and use common sense. Did you actually order anything for which you&#39;re expecting a
			confirmation? Did the email come from a store you don&#39;t usually order supplies from? If so, it&#39;s
			probably a phishing attempt.
			Don&#39;t hesitate to call a company&#39;s customer service line, your HR department or IT department to
			confirm that any such emails are legitimate - it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
